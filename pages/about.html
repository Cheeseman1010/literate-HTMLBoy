        <h2>Stuff About the Game</h2>
        <h4>Generic Stuff:</h4>
        <p>For an idea, this seemed like a great one before I started work on it.</p>
        <p>Boy was I wrong.</p>
        <p>Since this whole site is just a bunch of HTML with some CSS glitter on top, each frame of "the Original HTML Boy"
            is a separate webpage, coming out to be ~150ish pages in the end. And let me tell you, setting up all the buttons
            to link to the right page was an absolute nightmare. (and probably should've been done when I was more than half awake)
            So if you find a bug, let me know, even though I probably won't fix it.
        </p>

        <div class="about-image">
            <span class="about-image-item img1"><img src="/images/htmlboy1.jpg" /></span>
            <span class="about-image-item"><h6>The map used to make the game</h6></span>
            <span class="about-image-item"><h6>(Ain't it beautiful?)</h6></span>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>It's hard to see where I'm landing/heading with such a small screen, why didn't you make it bigger?</h4>
        <p>I didn't realize how inconvient this was until after I had built out the first fourth of the pages, and mapped out all the page links.
            Sorry it's a pain to navigate, and there isn't a lot of content to play. My other classes, time constraints, work, and sanity are holding me
            back right now from fixing these issues currently.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>If you were to build this again, what would you change?</h4>
        <p>If I was to do this with plain old HTML and CSS again, I'd make the screen bigger, and an option to change the color of the
            HTML Boy you're playing on. I had a cool purple one that my cousin gave me when I was younger and that thing was a blast to play on.
            Adding other levels/games to play on it would be a cool feature too.
